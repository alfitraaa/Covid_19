# SQL Covid Project
This sql project displays the query that I used to provide some analysis of Covid-19 data from January 1, 2020 to November 30, 2022.
<p> Datasets : https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths <br> 

I divided the downloaded dataset into two parts: <br>

- covid_death 
- covid_vaccinations

I've included the csv files, feel free to download it.
